### June 18  

[Iittala music festival](https://www.facebook.com/iittalanmusiikinkesa/) is over and has received plenty of attention in the media. A video clip on Yle broadcasting company, starting at 5:19, can be seen [here](http://areena.yle.fi/1-4160924?autoplay=true).  
  
Sakari Hildén from Hämeen Sanomat reviewed Martin's recital earlier in the week, writing:  
  
"Malmgren is a young but experienced pianist. His pianistic technique enables him to tackle even the most challenging works with ease. His program included music by Sibelius and Nielsen, two composers often compared with one another, as well as a number of lesser-known works. (...) Malmgren started with the Sibelius Sonatinas. In these works the casual sound of the Schimmel grand piano worked well, and the pianist captured their unpretentious, easy-going style.  
Nielsen's, in it's originally Lucifer-named misunderstood and very rarely played Suite op.45 is in it's exciting eccentricity far away from Sibelius's clearly defined feelings. Malmgren highlighted strongly the characters of the movements and captured for example the fourth movement's innocence aptly.(...)  
The main work of the evening was Ravel's mystical Gaspard de la nuit. Here the resistance of the instrument became evident; to achieve the richness of the sound, a better instrument would have been needed. Malmgren nevertheless managed to bring forth a respectable amount of colours from this one the most challenging pieces of the standard repertoire. (...)"

### July 8  
  
From the [Pianofortephilia](http://pianofortephilia.blogspot.com.au/2016/07/sydney-international-piano-competition_8.html) blog:  
  
"It is funny how the most interesting pianists get lumped together in a single session. MARTIN MALMGREN, who has shoulder length frizzy hair, is probably the most wayward and bizarre (in a good way) of the 32. He began his 20 minutes with Medtner's Prologue (from Stimmungsbilder Op.1), a perfect “once upon a time” set to music if any. Its E flat major entreaties soon gave way to Liszt's late and bleak Nuages Gris (Grey Clouds) in G minor, which pointed to the increasing level of dissonance as the music progressed. The broken final chord, left hanging in the air served as a prelude to Bartok's Three Etudes (Op.18), which was a summation of the Hungarian's idiom – rhythmic violence, impressionist harmonies and the exploration of variegated scents, textures and touches, all served to perfection with Malmgren's faultless pianism.  
His programme closed with Australian Brett Dean's Equality, but how many people in the audience knew this was a work for a vocalising pianist? Perhaps for the first time in this competition, one got to hear a pianist's voice as well, when he interjected “All men are bastards!” There were guffaws and dropped jaws a plenty in this feminist work, to which he added “We will fight for equality...” while pounding away on the keys, and wait for the punchline, “... until all women are bastards too!” This competition has sought for pianists of individualism and creativity, and I think they got more than they bargained for. Bravo!"

Hannu Hirvelä from Kaleva [reviews](https://www.facebook.com/pianistmartinmalmgren/posts/704937819608335) the performance of Rachmaninoff's 1st concerto with Oulu Sinfonia: "Malmgren's interpretation was masterly and I particularly liked the second and third movement's shimmeringly fresh expression.
The long piano solo at the beginning of the Andante was absolutely delicious, played more in the vein of a jazz ballad than of Slavic melancholy."  
  
### October 13

### February 20  
  
[Review](https://www.facebook.com/pianistmartinmalmgren/photos/pb.541862229249229.-2207520000.1424864830./604602209641897/?type=1&theater) from Martin's debut concert with Sinfonia Lahti:  
    
"A winner of numerous competitions and accolades, Martin Malmgren appeared as soloist in Prokofiev's 5th piano concerto. While the program leaflet described the concerto as cold and lacking memorable melodies, the melodies are actually there in abundance: they just are so quick and hearty, that attention is required from the listener in order to receive all information. The concerto speaks of the technical skill of its performers: if one can master this level of complication, neither the soloist nor the orchestra need to prove themselves any further."

## 2014   

  
### November 6  
  
Martin has just finished a recording session of Sibelius Three sonatinas, op. 67 for YLE, the Finnish broadcasting company. The recordings will be aired in 2015.

### September 15   

"The big offer of the evening was the Swedish pianist Martin Malmgren's interpretation of Prokofiev's 5th piano concerto, a work he won the Ilmari Hannikainen competition with in Jyväskylä this spring. And it should be said that Malmgren's interpretation feels thought-out and empathetic....In the Toccata movement Malmgren and the gang emphasized the boldness and in the Larghetto-movement, the sublime qualities became particularly prominent. One would certainly like to hear Martin Malmgren in all Prokofiev's piano concerti." - Review of Martin's performance with SE Ensemble in Hufvudstadsbladet. Full review [here](http://t.co/biaD6S1Ckz) (in Swedish)


### August 12   

A review of Martin's solo recital in Säfstaholm castle was recently published: 
   
"Nine composers and some twenty piano pieces was what the pianist Martin Malmgren conjured up from his piano-hat on his recital. A few well-known works got company with many less known and relatively modern works....  Malmgren truly challenges the audience with his wonderfully rich playing! One highlight of the recital were the two Skazkas by Medtner. Here Malmgren showed his lions paw, which impressed greatly....Martins touch, formidable technique and subtle feeling for diversity in nuances gives us a new big name among pianists."
